As you can read about here (blog link), an itchy and flakey scalp is caused by overgrowth of yeast on the scalp followed by an inflammatory reaction to the yeast. We attack this from both angles at the same time, which is different from any commercially available prescription or over the counter medication. </p>"

It is possible that the condition will eventually go away (sometimes when people move to a different part of the country this can happen), but we will not be able to predict when that will happen.</p>"

            "question": "Is it safe to use these medications on a long term basis?",
            "answer": "<p>As you can read about here (blog link), seborrheic dermatitis (the fancy term for an itchy and flakey scalp) is not curable. The yeast that causes this condition is found on the skin normally and is present everywhere in the world. So, even when it is eliminated from the body it will come back within a couple of weeks. Therefore we need to find medications that are safe and sustainable. Our products are formulated to be effective as quickly as possible, but also balanced to be safe to use on a long term basis. Our shampoo contains a very strong topical steroid, but as the contact time is just a few minutes 2-3 times a week the likelihood of side effects is very low. Conversely, we use a milder topical steroid in the scalp serum as the contact time is much longer. The combination of the two results in fast and sustainable results that are safe to use long term. If topical steroids are not for you though, stay tuned, we are developing other alternatives that we hope to offer soon!</p>"
